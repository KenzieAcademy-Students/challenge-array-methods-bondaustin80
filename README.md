# Kenzie Academy Challenge: Reimplement Array Methods

Follow the instructions provided on my.kenzie.academy for this challenge. The `code.js` file is a placeholder. Feel free to rename it and/or add additional files to the project.

Customize this README.md however you want to turn it into documentation for your project (including deleting these opening paragraphs). The only required section is **Reflection**, but if you used a unit testing framework, also fill in the **Running the Unit Tests** section. Be sure to use proper Markdown syntax in this file (here's a [cheatsheet PDF](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf) of the basic syntax).

## Running the Unit Tests

_(Instructions for how to install the unit testing framework and run the unit tests.)_

## Reflection

For a software developer, what are the benefits of good unit tests? Are there any drawbacks to writing unit tests?

The main benefit of unit tests are to make sure that the functions that you created actually return the intended values. They can help to find potential bugs or mistakes that the developer may have missed. The main drawback to writing unit tests are that the developer may not think of every potential outcome. The function may pass every unit test that the developer initially considered, but it may not work for other inputs that the developer didn't think about.
